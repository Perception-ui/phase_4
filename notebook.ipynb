    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "Online streaming platforms are the dominant form of media consumption and viewers face a paradox of choice when selecting films to watch. Avid watchers struggle to fully traverse their streaming catalogs, leading to subscriber frustration and an increased likelihood of churn. By leveraging the MovieLens dataset comprised of over 100,000 ratings applied to nearly 10,000 films by hundreds of users, we have a tremendous opportunity to push recommendation technology forward. Enhancing recommendations to navigate to what movie streamers prefer has the potential to profoundly impact viewer satisfaction for streaming platforms worldwide by connecting audiences with content that matches their interests. We can promote media discovery, encourage niche and inspire artistry through expanded access to cinema. Tackling the recommendations challenge remains imperative to unlocking the full creative and commercial potential of online streaming."
